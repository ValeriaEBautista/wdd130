    <h2>Val</h2>
    <p>Hello everybody! As you can see above, my name is Val. I was born in Honduras but moved to Texas a few years ago. My dream job is to become an analyst for any branch of the government and that's why I am doing Software Engineering as my major. The reason I decided to major in technology is because I was part of the Robotics team and the Technology Student Association in high school where I learnt the basics of coding and fell in love with it. I am very excited for this class and to meet all of you! </p>
    <p>A little bit about me, I am married to the love of my life. We moved to Idaho during the fall of 2021. Coming from the desert, I can tell you snow is not as fun as TV makes it look. But we are enjoying it here and we are looking forward to meeting more people and visiting all the beauty Idaho has to offer. I have been a member of the church all my life and I love the Gospel. BYU-I has introduced me to many amazing people and I am very greatful to be part of this institution.</p>
    <p>I look forward to working with all of you and I hope we can help each other and do our best together!</p>
